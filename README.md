# Myocardial-Infraction-Detection
## Abstract

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a cardiovascular disease (CVD), which manifests due to the
complete blockage of a coronary artery and spawns due to the rupture of atherosclerotic plaque. It
causes deprivation of oxygen to the heart muscles making them necrotic. MI is one of the leading
cause of deaths causing 9 million fatalities yearly worldwide, which is predicted to increase upto
12 million by 2030. MI progresses in three stages, namely, early MI (EMI), acute MI (AMI) and
chronic MI (CMI) characterized by its severity. With the onset of MI, the changes in
characteristics of ECG starts manifesting, therefore, it becomes imperative to perform ECG as
soon as possible. The variation in features enhances as the MI progresses, which aid cardiologists
to diagnose myocardial infarction properly. In several cases of MI, a person does not feel any
symptom before reaching to a critical condition [1]. This is because of the common symptoms of
MI progression, such as, feeling uneasy, dizziness, and light headedness are often ignored by
many people. Further, it may also happen that ECG performed in the initial stage of MI might not
be diagnostic, as the evolution of ECG variations may vary considerably from person to person.
Therefore, it becomes important to take serial electrocardiograms in certain intervals to get an
assured diagnosis.
